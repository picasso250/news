# FAQ
Q: How can I get an update when a new post comes out?
A: I post about my new post on this Twitter [@lilianweng](https://twitter.com/lilianweng/) account. There is also a [RSS feed](../index.xml) .
Q: What tool do you use for plotting?
A: I'm using Google Presentation (cloud version of PowerPoint).
Q: What if I see something incorrect in the post?
A: Send me an email: anotherlilian AT gmail.com if you have questions or find errors. Thanks 😊! But time of one person is limited and I'm really busy nowadays, so there may take some time for me to get to process it.
Q: Can I translate your posts to another language?
A: Yes and my pleasure! But please email me in advance and please keep the original post link on top (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad 🙁).
Q: Do you update your old posts?
A: Yes, I update my old posts periodically. Everytime I would add an one-line update message in blue on top of that post, like:
Q: Hmmm ... I have papers on super relevant topics but you didn't include them?
A: As you may know, it is pretty challenging to do a comprehensive literature review given a big topic. There are so so many papers in the wild. With Google scholar and recursive citation search, I get to see quite a lot of papers but still not all of them. You are more than welcome to shoot me an email with pointers to interesting but missing papers. Cheers!
Q: How can you keep up blogging?
A: "Pain is inevitable but suffering is optional" --- this is the first sentence of Haruki Murakami's book ["What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) . I love that book. His altitude towards running is pretty much aligned with how I feel about maintaining this blog.
