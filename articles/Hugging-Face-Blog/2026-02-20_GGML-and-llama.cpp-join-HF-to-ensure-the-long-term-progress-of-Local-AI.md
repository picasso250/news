# HTML_TAG_START GGML and llama.cpp join HF to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI HTML_TAG_END
Published February 20, 2026 [Update on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/ggml-joins-hf.md) [Upvote 471](/login?next=%2Fblog%2Fggml-joins-hf) +465 [Georgi Gerganov ggerganov Follow](/ggerganov) [Xuan-Son Nguyen ngxson Follow](/ngxson) [Aleksander Grygier allozaur Follow](/allozaur) [Lysandre lysandre Follow](/lysandre) [Victor Mustar victor Follow](/victor) [Julien Chaumond julien-c Follow](/julien-c) HTML_TAG_START
[HTML_TAG_START What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community? HTML_TAG_END](#what-will-change-for-llamacpp-the-open-source-project-and-the-community) [HTML_TAG_START Technical focus HTML_TAG_END](#technical-focus) [HTML_TAG_START Our long term vision HTML_TAG_END](#our-long-term-vision) We are super happy to announce that GGML, creators of Llama.cpp, are joining HF in order to keep future AI open. 🔥
[Georgi Gerganov](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov) and team are joining HF with the goal of scaling and supporting the community behind ggml and llama.cpp as Local AI continues to make exponential progress in the coming years.
We've been working with Georgi and team for quite some time (we even have awesome core contributors to llama.cpp like [Son](https://huggingface.co/ngxson) and [Alek](https://huggingface.co/allozaur) in the team already) so this has been a very natural process.
llama.cpp is the fundamental building block for local inference, and transformers is the fundamental building block for model definition, so this is basically a match made in heaven. ❤️
### What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community?
Not much – Georgi and team still dedicate 100% of their time maintaining llama.cpp and have full autonomy and leadership on the technical directions and the community.
HF is providing the project with long-term sustainable resources, improving the chances of the project to grow and thrive. The project will continue to be 100% open-source and community driven as it is now.
### Technical focus
llama.cpp is the fundamental building block for local inference, and transformers is the fundamental building block for definition of models and architectures, so we’ll work on making sure it’s as seamless as possible in the future (almost “single-click”) to ship new models in llama.cpp from the transformers library ‘source of truth’ for model definitions.
Additionally, we will improve packaging and user experience of ggml-based software. As we enter the phase in which local inference becomes a meaningful and competitive alternative to cloud inference, it is crucial to improve and simplify the way in which casual users deploy and access local models. We will work towards making llama.cpp ubiquitous and readily available everywhere.
### Our long term vision
Our shared goal is to provide the community with the building blocks to make open-source superintelligence accessible to the world over the coming years.
We will achieve this together with the growing Local AI community, as we continue to build the ultimate inference stack that runs as efficiently as possible on our devices.

This is a match made in heaven for the local AI ecosystem. Transformers as the model definition layer plus llama.cpp as the local inference layer, backed by HF's long-term resources, gives the entire community a stable foundation to build on for years to come.
The focus on packaging and user experience is especially important. Making local inference accessible beyond developers is how we get to an AI future that's open, private, and user-owned — not locked behind API calls.
Congratulations to Georgi and team. Open-source superintelligence that runs on your own hardware isn't just a technical goal, it's a trust model.

So basically HF, "acquires" an open source project. hmm. I've seen this before and it never ends well (see Trixbox, PCBSD, FreeNAS, etc..).
I sure hope history doesn't repeat itself (yet it always does).

Before you upvote. Raise your hand if you realize that hf.co is a business with the necessary end goal of making money . This isn't a bad thing; however, this blog post is so devoid of substance and so full of hypebole that one can't help but wonder.

I cant wait till hf adds a quota/limitation on amount of models you can quantize with future versions of llama.cpp requiring hf login /token to quantize a model (trust me bro its just basic telemetry) 😻
of course, when the noose tightens further it won't be officially discussed/acknowledged ( why would we?? we have so much to share with sell to the #community like this robot! look its so cute )

Check out stable-diffusion.cpp for this, or KoboldCpp if you want a fork that has both llamacpp and stablediffusioncpp integrated.

This is awesome news! Making llama.cpp and the GGML ecosystem more sustainable and widely supported will help local AI become more accessible and easier to use for everyone for sure.

Does this mean that we will have GGUF quants of models as they release, or at least support for gguf out of the box for new models in the future?

A great milestone for Local AI! For those already living daily in the ggml and llama.cpp ecosystem, this is a strong signal for what’s ahead. The alignment with Transformers brings clear strategic coherence. A solid move. Looking forward to what comes next.
